# Chess_Knight_Paths
Chess_Knight_Paths is a Python project that finds all minimum-length sequences for a knight to move from a starting cell to an ending cell on an empty chessboard. It accepts positions in algebraic notation, prompts user input, and generates visualizations of the paths in DOT, PDF, PNG, and GIF formats, including animations of the knight's movement.
